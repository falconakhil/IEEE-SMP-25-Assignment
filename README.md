# IEEE SMP Zero to One-Hot Assignment 2

## Overview

In this assignment, you will develop a deep learning pipeline that computes semantic similarity scores between two image datasets. The goal is to build a system that can understand and compare the semantic content of images, going beyond simple pixel-level comparisons.

## Important Guidlines

- Implement a deep learning based image dataset similarity pipeline
- Feel free to use any pre-trained models.
- As this is an open ended task, please explain your method and provide links to any papers you have used for this.

## Assignment Requirements

### Input

- **Dataset A**: A collection of images
- **Dataset B**: A collection of images

### Output

- **Similarity Score**: A numerical score indicating semantic similarity between the two datasets. You are free to define how this works.

## Tips

- To test your pipeline you can take a single dataset like CIFAR-10 or MNIST and make different versions of it by augmenting it using some image processing library.
- You can compare your results with classical metrics like SSIM,PSNR, MSE etc.
- I would suggest you to first look if there are existing works in this direction.

## Submission

- Fork this repository
- Create a folder under solutions with your name.
- Add your code there
- Create a README explaining the ideas and giving instructions on how to run your code.

Good luck with your implementation! ðŸš€
